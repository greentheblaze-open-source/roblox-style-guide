A simplistic, community-driven extension of Roblox's Lua Style Guide.

---

This guide covers best practices to follow when programming projects on the Roblox platform.

Derived from [Roblox's Lua Style Guide][roblox-lua-style-guide], this offers further rules, greater clarity, and a more intuitive format. If you value maintainability and readability within your code (and you don't want to waste time thinking about how it looks), this is your guide. Learning a style guide is a short-term endeavor, compared with the long-term struggles to understand ancient code.
